A lost Long Silence
lyrics:

All is calm
All is stil
old trees stand waiting
in  purest green

red crushed stones
pave the way 
this valley road
will guide you home

oh restless soul
when will you see
a lost long silence
makes you complete
a lost long silence 
the missing piece





Hey hey boy, i know what u want
flashing all the cash u have will never do the job
i need the
booty,booty,booty,booty,booty,booty shorts(the boys love)
booty,booty,booty,booty,booty,booty shorts(u wanna)
b my man ? not so fast!

booty,booty,booty,booty,booty,booty shorts(the boys love)
booty,booty,booty,booty,booty,booty shorts
